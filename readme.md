# Event Manager Company: Software QA Analyst/Developer Onboarding Assignment

Welcome to my submission for the Event Manager Company onboarding assignment as a Software QA Analyst/Developer. This repository reflects my hands-on work with API development, validation, testing, and Docker deployment. The REST API is running successfully with proper documentation, automated testing, and secure JWT-based authentication.

## ✨ Reflection

This assignment helped me solidify my skills in RESTful API development and software quality assurance. I learned how to:
- Debug deep issues in model-schema alignment
- Enforce best practices in password and username validation
- Write thorough automated test cases to push coverage over 90%
- Collaborate using GitHub effectively through issues, branches, and PRs
- Deploy and manage containerized services with Docker

The real-world simulation of issues, fixes, and peer review workflows was a valuable learning experience and a great confidence booster.
